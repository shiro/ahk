# WinUp

WinUp is an AHK script to make using the Windows OS a *lot* less painfull.

It provides features such as improved window hadnling, virtual desktop switching and various keyboard tweaks.

## Usage

Simply run the main script with `autohotkey (x64)`.

## Credits

The smooth desktop switching works with the help of [VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor/blob/master/README.markdown).

*note:*

*You probably first need the [VS 2017 runtimes vc_redist.x64.exe and/or vc_redist.x86.exe](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads), if they are not installed already.*
